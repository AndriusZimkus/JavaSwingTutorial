Implementation:

All examples can be reached from start window through the list of buttons.

The examples are saved in the ExamplesTreeMapAbstractClass and stored in a TreeMap.
TreeMap is preffered over HashMap for sorted keys.

In the TreeMap human readable names of examples/functions are paired with calls to the respective classes - this is achieved using ExampleInvoker functional interface and lambda expressions.
